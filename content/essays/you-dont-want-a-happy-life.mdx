Why do I do the things I do?

I was contemplating some of my life decisions recently. Why am I pursuing this founder lifestyle? Why do I want to do great things in the world? Why am I so obsessed with proving myself in some form or other?

I realised that in order to have this drive and hunger to get high on the social hirarchy, you must have something different from most people. In a way, you’re very much aware of your place on this social hierarchy, and because you give a shit, you’re trying to constantly prove yourself. The realisation is very simple, you just have to be very insecure in order to become a successful funder. In fact, I think the more insecure you are, the bigger your chances of success are.

At the same time, it’s a strange kind of insecurity. You have to be insecure enough about yourself, and give enough of a fuck to want to prove yourself, but at the same time not give too much of a fuck to the point where you just care what everyone thinks. I mean, making a successful startup is no easy task, and by no means do I think I’m close do achieving that feat. The thing is, you must be so insecure, but at the same time so marginalised by society, so that you end up wanting to prove yourself without caring what others think.

Strange life. Strange circumstances. But I guess that’s what makes up a good founder.

You can disagree, what the fuck do I know? I’m writing this after going out drinking and smoking some shisha with some friends.

All I wanted to share is that I am in part grateful for my insecurities. They give me purpose to some extent lol. You might say this shit is depressing, but hell no! I’m living my best life. I’m in a freaking castle! So I guess you just have to embrace your lifestyle, be grateful for having a life, and try to make the most out of what you have.

One other thing I realised more, that I used to be aware of nonetheless, is how much I despise people having a victim mindset. This can probably get anyone canceled, especially a 19yo kid, but I think you can turn most narratives into a good story. The shittier your initial parameters vs the final outcome, the better the story.

In the end, I think most people don’t necessarily want a happy life, they want a life with a good story. At least that’s what I want, so please consier everything I said as only being applicable to myself. There’s no rule of thumb here, only my rules for my life.

Anyway… Life is cute :):)
